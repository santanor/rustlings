// Oops! In this exercise, we have a variable binding that we've created on
// line 5, and we're trying to use it on line 6, but we haven't given it a
// value. We can't print out something that isn't there; try giving x a value!
// This is an error that can cause bugs that's very easy to make in any
// programming language -- thankfully the Rust compiler has caught this for us!
